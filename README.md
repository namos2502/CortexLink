You know the feeling. You are deep in a vibe coding session — ideas flowing, Claude keeping up — and then you need to hand something off to Copilot. Suddenly you are out of the zone, hunting for the right flags, checking docs, figuring out what `--allow-tool` even accepts. The flow breaks.

CoFluent fixes that.

It is a Claude Code skill plugin that gives Claude the full GitHub Copilot CLI reference — flags, permissions, patterns, model choices — baked right in. Install it once, and Claude already knows how to speak Copilot. No interruptions, no setup tax, no context switching. You stay in the zone and Claude handles the handoff.

The way it should work.

## Get started

Before installing, make sure you have the [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli) set up. It is a standalone tool — not the same as `gh copilot`:

```bash
brew install copilot-cli
copilot login
```

Then install CoFluent from inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add namos2502/agent-plugins
/plugin install cofluent@agent-plugins
/reload-plugins
```

Requires Claude Code v1.0.33+.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cofluent:auto` | Activates copilot-aware mode — Claude handles `copilot -p` calls on its own |
| `/cofluent:verify` | Checks everything is installed and you are logged in |
| `/cofluent:ask` | Asks Copilot a question |
| `/cofluent:suggest` | Gets a shell command for a task |
| `/cofluent:explain` | Explains a command, error, or snippet |
| `/cofluent:fix` | Fixes a bug or error (reads and writes files) |
| `/cofluent:review` | Reviews staged diff or a specific file |
| `/cofluent:help` | Shows this reference |

### Pick your style

**Hands-off** — run `/cofluent:auto` once and let Claude decide when to reach for Copilot. Good for longer sessions where you just want things to work.

**Hands-on** — use individual commands to point Claude at a specific task. You stay in control of every delegation.

## Under the hood

CoFluent ships a single skill file — `skills/copilot-cli/SKILL.md` — that Claude loads as its Copilot CLI reference. It covers the right flags for non-interactive use, tool permissions, model selection, and ready-to-run invocation patterns.

The base pattern Claude always follows:

```bash
copilot -p "..." -s --no-ask-user --no-auto-update --no-color --allow-tool='read'
```
